# Public version of this source code
This repo is a public version of the source code for the Twitter Lang app. The final app is built with R, JavaScript and Shiny and is based on data initially loaded and sourced from a 9 node cassandra cluster. If you got this far, we have to assume you can look after yourself with R and navigating this GitHub repo; we canâ€™t give detailed guidance or help.

If you do want to launch the final version of the viz, the massaged and cleaned data ultimatley used can be downloaded directly [here](https://github.com/gregce/W251-TwitterLanguage/blob/master/Visualization/tweet_emoticons.Rda) as an .Rda file. 

Long after this course has ended and our machines used to conduct this analysis are reclaimed, the app will persist [here on shinyapps.io](https://gregce.shinyapps.io/tweet_viz/)
